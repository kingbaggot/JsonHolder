         "Info": "Charles was a passionate patron of painters; he’d brought Van Dyck to England to be his official painter, and this is one of several paintings Van Dyck made of Charles on horseback. So this very regal, very elegant painting gives us a lot of clues about what kind of king Charles wanted to be seen as. He’s wearing armour, but he doesn’t look like he’s about to charge off to battle, does he? He is bare-headed, and his expression is sad, preoccupied, almost resigned, I think. He looks more like a philosopher than a king, which fits with the image Charles himself tried to create of a cultured, intellectual ruler. From his pearl earring to his long, cavalier hair and tragic expression, this is an image of a new kind of king: serious, cultured and conscious of a sacred duty.",

         "Info": "Most royal paintings are full of symbols of kingship; but one of the only clues that this is a King is the Latin sign on this tree, which reads CAROLUS I REX MAGNAE BRITANIAE - King Charles I of Great Britain. The thing is, that wasn’t technically true; Charles’ father King James I had been the first King of both Scotland and England, and Charles was determined to continue his father’s legacy and unite the two countries as Great Britain - but it wasn’t until seventy years later, decades after Charles was defeated in the English Civil War and executed, that Scotland and England were formally united. So, like most royal paintings, this one is perhaps a bit liberal with the truth. I think this is Charles as he saw himself, or maybe as he hoped to be seen - even more so when you remember that he was quite a small man, very conscious of his height, and seems to have preferred to be painted on huge great horses like this one.",

And indeed, many of her paintings show the kinds of things you don’t see depicted by male artists of the period: women being forced into compromised or sexualised positions by men, but with their distress clear on their faces and bodies. Artemisia took many of these female characters from Biblical stories or the lives of saints; here she has taken the story of Saint Catherine, a teacher and religious leader who defeated all opponents with piety, yes, but also with reason and strength of argument. And remember, this is a self-portrait; so here Artemisia depicts herself as the scholarly saint: with a determined, intense expression on her face, and the sleeves of her dress rolled up ready to get to work.",

I think this is such a strong painting, and it creates a very strong impression despite the almost drabness of the colours. She’s used very theatrical lighting, and her face is clearly highlighted, emerging out of the deep darkness on the right-hand-side of the painting, as if her skin is luminous. The harshness of the wooden, spiked wheel contrasts with the gentle rouge of her cheeks and the softness of the fabrics, especially the headscarf which trails down into delicate strands in the bottom right corner.",

In this case, there may be a bit more biography in this painting than most, but Artemisia isn’t hiding it; I think she wants us to hear what she’s saying loud and clear. When she was seventeen, Artemisia was raped by a painter who worked for her father. Artemisia was a witness in a trial that went on for months,and she was tortured with thumbscrews as part of the trial. Now her attacker was found guilty, but his conviction was overturned at the intervention of the pope amongst other people. At seventeen, Artemisia was already a breathtakingly talented painter working in her father’s studio, and yet in order to get justice she was forced to have her hands, the tools of her trade, crushed to prove her truthfulness. And here, just a few years later, she’s painting herself as Saint Catherine, who in the legend was a teenage princess and a scholar who defied the Roman Empire through eloquence and argument. Her hand rests on a spiked wooden wheel, a torture device called a Breaking Wheel which miraculously broke at a touch from the saint. Artemisia is looking out at us from this painting from over four hundred years ago, and I think it’s clear from the confidence and conviction on her face, that what she’s saying is: ‘Here I am. You can do what you want, say what you want about me but I know what’s true, and I know what’s right.’",

Now, I’m a photographer, and photography is all about shadows and highlights. I love the way that the artist, the female Iranian photographer Shirin Neshat, has framed Malala so that she’s emerging from the shadows. The starkness of the black-and white, and the way the shadow frames her head, with her face framed in turn by the dark, soft fabric of her hijab… I think it brings all the attention to her eyes, the intensity of her gaze, looking straight out at us in a challenging, confident, empowering gaze. This is a portrait from a female perspective, capturing a powerful, defiant young woman while she’s looking out at the world, looking out at us, and waiting to see what we’re going to do.",

The writing is a poem by the Pakistani poet Rahmat Shah Syel, written in 2011. The poem is called Malala II, and in it the poet is talking to the legendary folk hero Malala of Maiwand, who rallied her community to victory in a battle with the British in the second Anglo-Afghan war in  1880. The poet is talking to the folk hero about her younger namesake, the modern activist Malala.",

Her powerful gaze; the quality of the photograph, which looks like a painting because of its fine lines, its sharpness, its detail. It's clearly evident to me, in how the artist has chosen to portray her: for me this piece is as much about the artist as the sitter. It exudes this incredible strength, and I think Neshat sees herself in Malala: a reflection of her work that addresses individual freedoms or those under attack or oppressed by social ideologies.",

And so it’s not just about Kings and Queens and celebrities; the collection reflects all people. The very first picture, one of our most famous pictures is of an ordinary man, with no jewels or crowns or weapons or signs of statehood; a man from Stratford who made his living by the pen, and became one of the most celebrated writers of any era. I think it’s a great reminder that the most important, the most impactful people, the people we remember from a period of history, aren’t always the ones with the crown on their head or the big plaque on the wall.",

         "Info": "This is the only portrait of Shakespeare that has a good claim to have been painted from life, which means that of the handful of portraits that supposedly depict him, this one has the most evidence to support that claim. We believe it was painted by a painter called John Taylor who was a contemporary of Shakespeare. Now, there are other pictures of Shakespeare, probably not done from life, which show him as majestic, as well dressed, like a royal courtier. There have been times in history when people thought that this picture couldn’t be the great poet, the Bard, because he looks a little, well… scruffy. Untidy. He’s let himself go a bit, and he looks like a bit of a ruffian, with his earring and his collar undone, and this very… ambiguous expression. But I think that’s the heart of it. Like Shakespeare’s plays, this painting doesn’t let us say “this is what this means” or “this is what he’s thinking”. I think this is Shakespeare, because to me, this is a picture of an artist, a man who moved between the very lowest levels, and the very highest levels of his society, and who in his plays, understood all of life in between.",

But the National Portrait Gallery researchers reckon it’s probably your man Shakespeare. What we do know for sure is that the painting you are looking at was the very first painting EVER in the National Portrait Gallery’s collection. Sounds impressive, so long as it wasn’t the only one for long. One picture in a room, that is not a gallery, it’s just a painting.

What I found interesting was that he painted so many versions of this, so many Tom Joneses! I mean dozens of them. In order to get the one Tom Jones that he thought really captured the man. And I think this does capture Tom's charisma, his slight melancholy, his thoughtfulness, and also, what a handsome bloke he is!",

And the story of this painting actually mirrors Mary’s story. We don’t know much about the painter, Albert Challen, who may have been a friend or neighbour of Mary’s in London, and this painting wasn’t even found until 2004, because it was being used as the backing for another painting; hidden away for more than a century behind a picture of someone else. Now at last this painting, and Mary’s achievements as a medical pioneer, are here for all to see.",

It’s such an empowering painting; her pose is quite heroic, she’s gazing away with authority, as if surveying her domain, and the layers of colour add a real boldness and importance. The highlights and shadows on her face create depth and texture that emphasizes her weathered skin and reminds us of her age, but also her adventurous life and her bravery as a war nurse. And then there’s this powerful red, alongside this very royal blue of her clothing… in many ways it’s a very regal painting, which feels right for Mary, the queen of the nursing brigade!",

Mary was extremely proud of her work during the war and her devotion as a healer, which went right back to her  childhood as part of a long tradition of Jamaican and West African Doctresses. Mary said in her biography that she had “from early youth a yearning for medical knowledge and practice which never deserted me…. And I was very young when I began to make use of the little knowledge I had acquired from watching my mother, upon ‘Great Sufferer’ – my doll… whatever disease was most prevalent in Kingston, be sure my poor doll soon contracted it.”\n",

Mary travelled the world as a nurse throughout her life, healing the sick and even setting up a hotel during the Crimean War to look after sick and injured British troops, and later in her life, the soldiers she’d healed would throw huge benefits in her honour.

But I think it’s a perfect sculpture for people who study or practice  life drawing. At the RA, there are a lot of casts that look like this, either destroyed or made in that way to model the human figure. In real life, models do have to make awkward and maybe embarrassing poses in order for us to learn about the realities of the human body.",

Looking at all the different half-done drafts at her feet, I feel like maybe the title of this painting could have been ‘Process’. It seems like she has done a few drawings, and is trying to perfect whatever she’s working on. We mainly focus on her pose, her stance, her glare. I think it’s very intense. Which is why the background of clouds gives it this very dreamy effect. There’s the intensity of process, and then there’s the dreamy, kind of blue-sky thinking all around it.",

         "Info": "Angelica Kauffman was one of the two female founding members of the Royal Academy. She was actually born in Switzerland, and the world she was born into was not one in which women had easy access to artistic training and schools. But she was an incredibly talented artist who was recognised as a prodigious talent even as a young child.  She came to England and worked alongside Sir Joshua Reynolds, the first president of the Royal Academy and one of the most famous painters of the day. It’s a painting about the process of making art, using a female artist as its subject, painted at a time when female artists were underrepresented and underestimated. So it’s a powerful statement, especially as the four paintings the“Elements of Art”  were commissioned to decorate the council room of the first Royal Academy building at Somerset House. The work still hangs in the entrance hall of the Royal Academy building at Burlington House, so there’s no doubt that Kauffman has influenced generations of artists after her.",

So this painting is showing one of an artist’s most fundamental skills: the first moment of making marks on a blank paper or canvas, with the artist practising their skill copying a plaster cast of a famous sculpture, like all students at the Academy. As a woman, Kaufmann was not permitted to move to the next stage: studying real nude male human forms. But nonetheless, even though this is a painting of anartist practising a core skill, it’s also full of classical references and other touches that show Kaufmann placing herself alongside the other great artists of her day - the subject of the painting has a classical greco-roman profile, and stylisedhairand pose, while the columns in the background invoke the great architects of Antiquity or the Renaissance. The artist iss showing her technical skill, but also her more elevated, poetic vision; which is what Reynolds thought artists should aspire to.",

Christian also painted Amir Khan, and Alan Cumming, and in all those portraits he manages to get the sense that there is movement happening.",

I think it shows a really strong relationship with the painter, Clemence Dane, who was an artistic prodigy in her own right and who won an Oscar for writing the film Perfect Strangers. There was obviously a lot of trust between the painter and the sitter, between these two artists, because here Clemence has captured the famous showman in a moment of introspection; there’s nothing of that flamboyance, and it’s unposed, dreamy, kind of vulnerable even.",

We know that Coward was considered an artistic polymath; he was a playwright, an actor, a lyricist and composer, and clearly he was trying to broaden his artistic horizons still further. So it’s a painting about painting, about the creative process perhaps. The colour and pattern of the background could almost give us a sense of what’s going on inside his head, and yet it’s almost as though he’s disappearing into the background too, as though he’s become utterly lost in the creative process.",

Seurat is well known for his development of the technique known as pointillism, which is where tiny individual dots of different colours are used together to create an overall colour effect. As with a lot of art movements, its name, ‘pointillism’, was originally used by critics to make fun of it! But, although in 1884 Seurat was already studying the new sciences of colour and optics which would inspire the technique, this isn’t a pointillist painting, although he is experimenting  with a new brushstroke, criss-cross technique called Balaye - and you can see this in the grass in the foreground of the painting . But the boy in the hat stands out, doesn’t he? He’s almost haloed in a different kind of light. And if you look closely you can see the orange hat was reworked with dots of red and blue, building up an impression of colour. Right there, that is the beginning of pointillism.",

In Seurat’s time, paintings of this size were usually associated with grand, historical or mythological paintings - not chill riverbank scenes of ordinary Parisians sitting on the grass. Seurat is elevating the everyday here, showing ordinary people lost in their thoughts, but on a grand scale. At the same time, this very ordinariness caused some to criticise the painting. Seurat submitted it to the 1884 Salon of the Académie des Beaux-Arts, the biggest art exhibition in Europe, but it was rejected partly because it lacked epic grandeur. So Seurat banded together with some like-minded artists and staged their own exhibition of independents - but even then, this painting was hung in the exhibition’s beer hall! It wasn’t until decades later that this painting was widely seen as a masterpiece, and now it’s one of the highlights of the National Gallery collection.",

In 1888, hats were very much the smart phone of their day. Everyone had one. George was only 24 when he painted this masterpiece depicting an idyllic Parisian summer’s day over 130 years ago, and it’s pretty astonishing how contemporary it looks now. Everyone’s socially distant, there’s a factory in the background polluting the air and, if you look carefully in the left hand corner, you’ll see a laptop. Oh, no. It’s a dog.",

There’s always visual puns in surrealist work, things that don’t make sense, there’s always unexpected weird meanings unless the artist says, “This is what I’m trying to say”. Because Agar was quite a unique, unpredictable individual, there’s not much realism in this work compared to others. Maybe it’s not meant to make sense: whatever she's trying to perceive or depict, maybe you get it or maybe you don't. But I wouldn't think she'd want to explain what's going on.",

         "Info": "I think this is such a bold piece of work. Remember the title: Collective Unconscious. It’s very relevant I think. At this moment in time, in 2020, everyone is a bit confused. There’s a pandemic, and no-one knows what’s going to happen next. At the period in the 70s when this was painted, there was also a lot going on in the collective unconscious. In life, things are unpredictable, things are spontaneous and happen by chance. Even when things are organised, they’re in amongst other chaotic elements. And I think in this work Agar is reflecting all of that. Agar herself said that in order to be an artist, one must have “new possibilities of discovery.” Maybe this painting is about that journey of discovery. I think no matter when it’s presented, especially with this title, this painting will always be relevant and timeless.",

I don’t think there are definitive answers to these questions; in fact I think maybe this painting is about us asking those questions. If we learn that thehe artist, Eileen Agar, was fascinated by sea shells and molluscs, fossils, bones and shells, and spent a lot of time in Paris at the Jardin des Plantes looking at these kinds of objects,it might be that you can see some of these kinds of shapes in this painting… but others might be content to be drawn into the shapes and colours of the painting, and feel rather than understand. I think by the time Agar was painting  artists were more and more aware of the different ways a viewer might engage with a painting, and also we as viewers bring more and more of ourselves to every work we look at. This painting seems to resist meaning; it can become an exploration of  you bring to it. I’m not sure myself what she's thinking but I'm also not sure that matters.",

She was often thought of as part of the Surrealist movement, but actually she didn’t identify with that label herself. In some ways this painting might reminds us of a classic abstract painter. But, are these real objects presented to us differently to enable us to better understand them or are they moving us away from the real thing, with shapes and colours that seem like their meaning is something beyond bodily reality.",

To me, in a way, it’s depicting the position of women,  and the certain way or stance we have to navigate the world. The woman performer here is the centre of attention, and she’s got this kind of kung-fu stance that is historically not associated with women. If a guy did that pose we might say he's powerful, strong, disciplined. If a woman does this, what is she trying to do? Impersonate a man? Especially with her shaved head, I think there are definitely questions of gender at play. And when you’re a woman or a person of colour, with a strong stance or manner of being, then you sometimes get accused of being disruptive or angry. It’s important to squash those stereotypes. Sonia Boyce is a strong artist with a very definitive vision. And she's making history by being the first black woman to represent the UK at the Venice Biennale.",

It may look like a very abstract work, but when you get in close you can see that these aren’t abstract shapes; it’s a photographic still of a whole other work of art. It’s a still from a film - a film of a live immersive performance directed by the artist Sonia Boyce. And the image of a female performer is repeated and multiplied within the painting, with the body and limbs of another performer visible behind her. The central performer is reflected, almost confronting herself, and yet the way the photo has been arranged, with the performer’s hand meeting her reflection’s hand, almost like a connection between them. It isn’t a connection between a real person and their reflection - somehow they are all reflections, carefully arranged. Even though we’re outside this photograph, looking in, I think the artist wants us to draw us in, to feel like we’re part of the image and the movement, not just a viewer.",

Actaeon is the male hunter at the left of the painting and, in the original ancient myth, he accidentally stumbles upon the goddess Diana, who’s seated on the right, when she’s bathing in a spring in a forest. Outraged to be seen naked, Diana curses him and transforms him into a stag, and he is hunted down and killed by his own hounds. Titian is showing us a frozen moment just as Actaeon pulls back that red cloth; from that instant, his fate is sealed. And although Actaeon is the one who is clothed, he is the one who looks the most vulnerable, doesn’t he? The women’s nudity doesn’t make them the victims here, because they are the ones who are doing all the looking; in some ways they have the power.",

         "Info": "Art historians have typically considered the five nude white women in the centre of the painting to be nymphs, that is, mythical companions of the goddess, and labeled the Black woman at the far right a servant or attendant. However, the painting is based on a poem by Ovid, who names six nymphs in the poem, and there are six women in the painting other than Diana - when you include the Black woman. In fact, Ovid describes one of the nymphs, Crocale, which means ‘beach’ or ‘seashore’, as being particularly good at doing Diana’s hair. The Black woman’s position and close attendance to Diana’s head has recently led some scholars to identify her as potentially Crocale. Venice, where Titian lived, was a particualrly multicultural place in the 16th Century and home to numerous people of colour, so Titian would certainly have encountered Black people in normal life. In fact, art historians generally agree that unlike the white nymphs, who all have the same almost generic face, the Black woman’s face is so distinctive that it must have been painted from life.",

         "Info": "Titian was by far the most famous painter in Europe by the time this painting, one of six, was commissioned by Phillip II, who was probably the most powerful man in Europe, and a young man in his twenties besides. The six-painting commission was unusually flexible: as Titian had free reign over the subject matter and composition. And after he'd completed the first painting, he writes to Phillip, and tells him that in this one, the front part of the naked body is visible; but in the next painting he sends, will be showing the opposite side of the body. Here in this painting, in the centre, we see the naked nymphs from a range of angles, but also see a range of reactions on their faces, from shock and shyness to almost titillation - and yet, they are all waiting to see what their mistress Diana will do. And what she’s going to do is curse Actaeon to a very violent death. Titian is certainly presenting a range of female nakedness, but also asking difficult questions: while you are looking at all this nudity, who is looking back? And who is really in control?",

         "Info": "You’re looking at the painting “Diana and Acteon” by Titian, from around 1556, and it tells the story of a situation we’ve all been in before. The story of an idiot who forgot to knock on the curtain before entering a ladies changing room. The idiot in question is Acteon, the hunter on the left hand side of the painting, and he’s walked in on Diana, the Goddess of the Hunt, while she’s having a bath (admittedly with 6 other people, or, ‘nymphs’ as they were known back then), and in a move I can only be impressed with, she does what any of us would do in this situation: splashes him with water, curses him, and turns him into a stag. Good for her! This painting shows the moment just as Actaeon barges in, and Titian’s captured what must surely be one of the most exquisitely awkward moments in all of art. If you’re feeling a bit awkward looking at this painting, there’s a little dog in the right hand corner. Just look at the dog. Keep your eyes on the dog.",

         "Info": "This painting continues a strong tradition of flower painting which began the 1600s, particularly in the Dutch tradition. But by the time Moser was painting it was also  a period of scientific enlightenment and close study of nature. If a flower painter couldn’t have access to a real flower because it wasn’t in season, they might compile an image from botanical drawings and manuals. This meant that artists could present arrangements of flowers that could never actually happen in real life, because one or other of the blooms would have wilted. To an audience in the 1700s, this could have been a reminder of the passage of time, and the impermanence of all ‘worldly’ things. Moser was a highly educated artist, and she would certainly have known that she was engaging in the Dutch tradition of vanitas - where paintings remind us of the emptiness of putting too much value on fleeting beauty, when life is short.",

         "Info": "Tracey Emin is someone that I really admire. I think she’s a bold, badass artist who doesn't suffer no fools. People sometimes say that this is a loose self portrait, but I'm not really sure. We’re all human; we have our ups and downs, but somehow I can never imagine Emin doing this pose in real life. When I first saw this work I thought there's definitely some religious connotations. If you go back to the title, \"Trying to Find You 1\", it has an emotive feel. Who are we trying to find? God? A partner? There’s lots of meanings behind it, but there’s definitely some elements of romanticism, and eroticism. And Emin does get criticised for her drawings being unrealistic, but I like how messy it is. I don't think romance or religion are neat or tidy or ordered.",

         "Info": "This female body is just an outline: you can see the background colours through the body. Emin’s self-portraits will often just be outlines like this, without blocks of colour - she doesn’t fill them in. I guess that's why some people say there's weakness or vulnerability in this painting, because there's not much detail. But I think being an outline doesn't make it either weak or vulnerable. I think it makes it strong and minimalist. You get what you see. You don’t need the details of hair, toenails and so on; the outline is powerful and strong. I think being vulnerable is a powerful move which shouldn't be seen as a sign of weakness. Emin puts herself out there, and there's a power in nakedness, in baring your flaws and insecurities.",

         "Info": "What we know of an artist’s life often leads us to interpret their work in one way or another, and when we talk about art we need to make sure not to confuse the artist and the artwork. But, I think there is something so… autobiographical about this painting. It’s called ‘Trying to Find You One’, and I think combined with the colours, the rawness, it creates this sense of searching, questing, almost desperation in seeking something. Emin has always been very honest about her own quests and searching and sexuality and relationships, and her work often lays that open in a way that isn’t at all glamorizing. Even those red lines that make up the woman’s body in the painting - when I look at what she does, it makes me think of the blood that runs in her veins, and the blood that women bleed. The quite visceral gritty qualities of it that come out of suffering and questing and that's something Emin is open about and talks about a lot, and it’s one of the things that make her such an exciting artist.",

         "Info": "I think whenever a modern artist shows a female nude , inevitably, they’re engaging with a long tradition in Western art , running from Venus in antiquity through centuries of representations of women. These are so often about the ideal, beautified female body presented for the male gaze and male consumption. One of the things I like about Tracey Emin is that this is still a work that could be available to a consumer in that way, that could have that eroticised element, but it doesn’t perform for the delight of the viewer. It’s doing something else. The sense of intimacy, the woman’s pose of supplication or despair, the way her breasts hang down - it’s not trying to be erotic, and it’s not trying to be for us - I think this is a very personal story, that the artist is sharing with us, perhaps to make us think about our own stories.",

I think it’s clear she got to know him quite well from this painting.

I also love the shadow and highlight detail used in the flesh tones of his face, which show depth, which show texture, which show an expression. It's sculptural for me; he stands out as a sculpture. It's a 3D feeling when I see Willard; I feel he's in front of me, singing.",

I think artists need to be invited in, and Elaine was fantastic at just chatting to everybody.

Van Gogh painted this for a specific room, for a specific occasion, to welcome his friend who was coming to visit. Van Gogh was desperate for friendship and for the respect of other painters, and he hoped that the famous painter Gauguin would want to join in his wild plans to form a community of artists. So he painted a whole series of sunflower images, including this one, to hang in the guest room before Gauguin arrived for a visit; yellow being a traditional colour of friendship. It’s such a simple gesture of welcome, such a clear desire for connection, and unfortunately the whole thing ends in disaster. We’ll never know the whole story, but Gauguin and Van Gogh had a huge argument, and at some point in the incident Van Gogh famously cut off part of his ear. Gauguin left, and the two never met again. It’s a story with a sad ending, like Van Gogh’s life, but also with an uplifting kind of afterlife: because now, this simple, hopeful painting has outlasted any disagreement and become one of the most famous and beloved pieces of art ever made.",

         "Info": "What is it that’s so special about this painting? One answer is the way that Van Gogh used colour. He was experimenting with cutting-edge paint technology at this point: specifically, the tube of paint. Before this, paints had to be mixed by hand and used before they dried out, but the invention of the air-tight metal paint tube - the precursor to the modern plastic toothpaste tube - meant that artists could buy and store large amounts of vibrant new colours - including Chrome Yellow. And look what he did with all that new colour! There’s something luminous about this painting; it looks like it’s been lit from behind. When you see reproductions, or see it on posters you can see that, yes, it could be quite a conventional still life. But when the light hits it, this painting speaks to you, and it stands out like a lit window whether it’s on a street corner or in a room full of other masterpieces.",

The yellow colour is the first thing that grabs you, and Van Gogh loved to use that colour, but when you look at it there’s not just yellow - there’s burnt orange, and even golden parts within the flowers themselves, and the dark and light greenery of the stems and leaves gives it a real vibrancy. And then there’s a sudden darkness in the seed heads. And there’s more going on here than just a vase of flowers from the garden: many of these flowers are already dead, with their petals fallen and just the round seed head remaining - the flower on the far right has just one petal about to fall. So actually, this is a painting with a lot of dead things in it, but which also contains the seeds of new life.",

Mainly because it was painted by a genius as a present for Gaugin, another genius (a bit like Drake writing a particularly good rap for, I dunno, Snoop Dogg), but also because it is a lasting image that has been reproduced globally in magazines, art prints, posters, calendars, you name it. And who wouldn't want something this warm and melancholy hanging in their house? Doesn't beat seeing the real thing though, or even the amazing AR version right in front of you. Also, have a look.

And that’s why it’s all a bit blurry. No one can expect David Bowie to sit still for long. Bowie recorded three albums during this and changed his hairstyle four times. Luckily, the perm didn’t make it into the final painting.",

Because they were both so cool, they never actually spoke to one another until the 1990s, when Stephen finally caught the eye of Bowie after the singer saw his painting of Marlene Deitrich. From that meeting, Stephen painted Bowie several times including one portrait with David’s wife Iman. Probably got some sort of two-for-one deal by then, I imagine. All the best artists do loyalty cards.",

So much of it is the pose and the profile, the position of the head on the shoulders; it has animation, and feels like it’s always in motion. And there’s a suggestion of an eye there, looking out from between the brushstrokes. Or, what I imagine to be an eye - there can be many different eyes - but that’s because I think this painting is about imagination. Just like Bowie’s work. So for me, I almost imagine that eye almost peeking out through this curtain of colour, like he’s backstage, getting ready for his performance.",

Finer would deliberately let his paint slide and drip and form new shapes, and so it’s almost as if the painting captures a single movement in a process of change and evolution. The more I look at it, the more it reminds me not so much of Boiew, but of his quality, his manner and his performance. Because he was a masquerader; always incarnating himself into different identities. And so this painting isn’t just another snapshot of David during one of his phases, but captures something of that essence of constant change.",

It’s portable, and I think it’s very personal, because it was probably only used by Richard himself, for personal prayer and devotion, and as a reminder of the link between his power and the Church. It’s almost like a private little chapel which could be carried wherever the King went. I think that’s something very special; you’re looking at something that wasn’t made for public consumption; a breathtakingly beautiful artwork that was private to the most powerful man in the country over six hundred years ago; and now it’s here for all to see.",

It’s full of details which mark it as a specific, custom piece of art intended for one man, King Richard II of England. On the left panel, the three men standing are all saints important to Richard; Richard himself is kneeling on the ground, wearing a gold collar with broom-pods, the symbol of his dynasty. Even the blue-clad angels on the right-hand panel all have a badge in the shape of a white hart or stag, another of Richard’s symbols; it’s almost as if he’s branded them with his logo. But, in the politics of Richard’s time, these badges were very controversial; he’s really saying, all these angels are part of my household; that even angels owe fealty to the King.",

The lion is an important part of the story of Saint Jerome - he is said to have removed a thorn from a lion’s paw, taming it, during his wanderings in the wilderness. According to the tale, after converting to Christianity Jerome became disillusioned with the worldly temptations of Rome, and escaped to live as a hermit in the desert outside Bethlehem. You can see here how Dürer has used fine brushstrokes to highlight the mane of the lion, just like he’s used for the Saint’s beard - they seem to embody gentleness and power at the same time.",

You can’t see the back of this painting (unless you come into the Gallery, that is!), but it shows a dark, cloudy sky with a fiery red comet or meteor, which might also suggest the end of the world too.",

Nearby on the ground is a robe and hat of the same red colour - to an audience in Dürer’s time, the late Fifteenth Century, this was the unmistakable uniform of a Cardinal of the church. Although this uniform didn’t exist in the Fourth Century when Jerome lived, the symbolism is clear - he has set aside his office and rank in order to be closer to God. And don’t miss the tiny birds in the bottom right corner - these are goldfinches, often used as symbols of the Passion of Christ. One popular medieval legend said that the red colour on their breast was caused when a goldfinch flew down and plucked a thorn from Jesus’s head, and was splashed with his blood.",

There’s a painting of a comet on the reverse side. The reason the portrait is that size is so it was easy to carry around. There was no Instagram back in 1496, so if you wanted to scroll through your pics on the bus, you had to bring the actual paintings with you. Which was great if you liked Saint Jerome, but a real pain if you were into, for instance, the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. So, who carried this artwork around? We don’t know for sure, but the painting was probably made for private worship. Which is also exactly how Instagram works.",

And that’s what we learn from this great work. If you get the chance to do a lion a favour, jump at it. You have got a mate for life. You’ll never not get that table at the pub. The painting is full of religious symbolism, which is fair. He’s a saint. That’s his thing. The bright yellow of the sunrise in the background represents the intensity of Jerome’s prayer, but also he’s beating himself with a rock, and the dark, foreboding sky suggests something potentially terrible is on its way. The end of the world or judgement day perhaps? Good luck, God. No way am I judging a man who is mates with a lion.",

         "Info": "This painting, ‘Van Gogh’s Chair’, is one of a pair of chair paintings by Van Gogh, with the other being ‘Gauguin’s Chair’. Gauguin was a successful artist, much more so than Van Gogh, and Van Gogh had invited him to Arles in the South of France, desperately hoping that the more famous painter would join in with Van Gogh’s plan to form an artist’s commune. Van Gogh may even have bought the two chairs specifically for Gauguin’s visit. Van Gogh began work on the two chair paintings in the early part of Gauguin’s visit, when things seemed to be going well. They are quite companionable companion pieces, but they also reflect the two artists’ very different personalities. Where Gauguin’s chair is an elaborate, imposing piece in darker colours, here we can see Van Gogh’s chair is simple and rustic, but set in bright sunlight and with quite cheerful colours. Sadly Gauguin’s visit ended in tragedy - after some kind of argument between the two, Van Gogh famously mutilated his ear, Gauguin left, and the two never spoke again. After a stay in hospital, we know that Van Gogh continued working on this painting. From his simple pipe and tobacco, resting on the seat, to the knots and imperfections in the wooden legs, it’s clear there is something intensely personal about this image.You can find out more about Gauguin’s disastrous visit to Van Gogh, and how it influenced Van Gogh’s paintings by finding Van Gogh’s Sunflowers in the Augmented Gallery, at Fortnum and Mason’s on Piccadilly.",

         "Info": "This painting of a simple, empty chair on a bare tiled floor is one of Van Gogh’s most iconic works. There’s often a sense of absence when an artist shows us an empty chair, and Van Gogh wrote that he had wept when he saw his father’s vacant chair after his father’s death in 1885. He also owned and loved an engraving by Luke Fildes called ‘The Empty Chair’, which showed the deserted study and chair of the novelist Charles Dickens on the day he died. And yet, this is a bright, sturdy image of a chair which Van Gogh has infused with his personality. Look at the blue edging on the yellow chair legs, how boldly they stand out. And look at the chair leg nearest to us - it’s at an angle, and might seem to be a bit wonky or unsteady, but I think this gives the chair a strong stance, a sense of squaring up to us as we look at it. Finally, don’t miss the simple box on the left edge of the painting, which bears Van Gogh’s signature, ‘Vincent’, and which seems to hold sprouting onions - a sign of new life, and maybe a sign of hope.",

It was painted in 1888 and one of a pair of furniture based artworks Vincent Van Gogh did that year along with Gaugin’s Chair, which was a painting of five dogs playing poker. No, only joking, it was actually a painting of Gaugin’s chair. There’s quite a big difference in the two paintings. Gaugin’s chair is elegant and finely carved with novels sitting on the seat, it’s in darkness too which gives it an air of mystery. While Van Gogh’s chair, as we can see here, is simple and functional with his pipe and tobacco sitting on it. It’s a much more humble painting. Keep in mind that, in 1990, one of Van Gogh’s paintings sold for $75 million. So, remember: stay modest, kids. There’s money in it.",

He’s painting the chair, isn’t he? That’s not the point. The point is Vincent Van Gogh’s fascination with absence. It began a few years before this painting after Vincent’s father died and the sight of his father’s empty chair brought the artist to tears. The empty chair, isolated within the canvas, has poignancy. It asks you to look and consider what is absent. A chair left vacant can become a memento of the person who once rested there. Not my chair, though. There’s normally just crumbs and a big bum imprint.",

Sadly, and famously, that symbol of friendship went right out the window (as so many friendships do) the night that Van Gogh threatened Gaugin with a knife and then he cut a part of his own left ear off. Gauguin suddenly remembered he’d left the oven on and returned to Paris pretty sharpish. And sadly, Vincent never saw his friend again.",

         "Info": "I think this is just such a beautiful painting. Many of Raphael’s works are very angelic, and have such an extraordinary quality to them. Saint Catherine was converted to Christianity after seeing a vision of Christ, and here we can see her looking up towards a heavenly glow in the sky with a kind of mild ecstasy. Even though we know that Catherine was a martyr who was tortured for her beliefs, in this painting there’s primarily a sense of joy, as though we’re seeing the moment of revelation. She’s turning her face upward and away from us, as if she has a private understanding with heaven, where she knows she’ll soon be going. The faintest trace of a halo around her head reminds us of her connection with the golden light in the sky.",

The blue of Saint Catherine’s robe may be meant to evoke the Virgin Mary, while the red of her outer robe, and the way it almost pours over the wheel in the bottom right, may be meant to remind us of blood and the Saint’s martyrdom - in the legend Saint Catherine was threatened with torture upon the wheel, before God destroyed it with a thunderbolt. And don’t miss the gauzy, almost completely transparent cloth going across her breast and over her shoulder - Raphael really is a master of these delicate textures.",

It’s almost as if this reflects the clarity of the moment of revelation. The horizon of the painting is quite low, below the level of Catherine’s shoulders, which gives her a huge amount of sky to stare into. And Catherine herself looms very large in this painting - she occupies a lot of space and seems to be a scale larger than the landscape, as though she is a giantess whose spiritual stature makes her too big for this world.",

Catherine was a princess in the 4th century, she converted to Christianity and, during a vision, married Jesus. Good catch, Catherine. His dad has houses EVERYWHERE. Then Emperor Maxentius, who immediately sounds like a bad egg, gets so cross - because Catherine refuses to give up her faith and her new husband - that he orders Catherine to be tied to a spiked wheel and tortured to death. Oh, no! How is Catherine going to get out of this one? Easy. The spiked wheel gets hit by a lightning bolt and is destroyed. Hooray! Well done, Catherine. That showed them! Anyway, they cut her head off after that, but she was doing great up until then.",

He was also incredible at beatboxing, and he always won at pub quizzes, although I’ve just been told that I made those last two things up and I’m not to do it again. Fine. Doing all those amazing things and he still had time to squeeze this in and so many classic artworks. He was so prolific, it’s no wonder he’s thought of as part of the great trinity of renaissance masters along with Da Vinci and Michaelangelo, and it probably explains why he died of exhaustion at 37. Say what you like about Timmy Mallet or Banksy but they know when to put their feet up.",

Hélène stands amongst her father’s art collection, behind her father’s empty chair. And she seems almost dwarfed by the size of that chair, doesn’t she? She’s kind of fenced off by it - she’s edged back almost flat against the wall, and there seems to be very little space in this room, or in this painting, for her. Look at the empty chair of the father, here, and compare it to Van Gogh’s own painting of an empty chair, which you can find in the Augmented Gallery on Trafalgar Square. Though they both prominently show empty chairs, the two paintings create very different moods and different kinds of absence.",

Before making this painting, Degas had planned to paint a double portrait of Hélène with her mother, perhaps as a companion piece to the one with her father, but unfortunately by this time Hélène’s mother had died. Instead, we have Hélène, now aged twenty-three, surrounded by her father’s collection of antiquities and objets d’art - that is, pieces of art - but she’s also hedged around with absences and signs of death, from the area of plain wall behind her shoulder, which creates a triangle of negative space in the centre of the canvas, to the blank documents on her father’s desk. Even the Egyptian funeral statues in the glass case to the left - they have their backs to Hélène, and we know that Degas exaggerated their size. They’re much bigger here than the real ones which Rouart owned, so Hélène is shrunk even further by comparison. It’s almost as though Degas is making her just another object in her father’s collection.",

That is definitely - and I won’t hear any arguments about this - Hélène Rouart in her father’s study. I mean, if Degas decided to call it ‘Hélène Rouart in a Batman Outfit’ or ‘Hélène Rouart in the Middle of a Snooker Match’, we’d all be furious. But, luckily, Degas painted exactly what was asked of him. He was commissioned to paint Hélène by her father, in the same way that famous people these days are commissioned to do videos on Cameo. It’s not exactly like that. No one talks about ‘Happy Birthday, Maureen by Van Gogh’ or Monet’s late-period masterpiece ‘Get Well Soon, Rodney’.",

Although, looking at the size of that chair, I reckon Hélène’s dad might actually be a giant. Hélène looks dwarfed by the chair and all the other objects in her father's collection. Degas even painted those Egyptian statues much bigger than they were in real life. So, we can only imagine how tiny Hélène must have been in real life.",

But that is exactly what Henri Rouart, Hélène’s father and Edgar Degas’s friend, wanted. He didn’t want a painting of his daughter in her own environment surrounded by her own things. No, he wanted a beautiful painting of his study and all the possessions he’s collected. Paintings, drawings, Egyptian statues, Chinese artworks, a stupidly big chair, his own daughter and we can only conclude that Hélène’s father was really very hard work.",
