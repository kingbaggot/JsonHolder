         "Info": "Hello, I’m Matthias Wivel, the Aud Jebsen Curator of Sixteenth-Century Italian Paintings at the National Gallery and the curator of the exhibition Titian: Love, Desire, Death. It’s a pleasure talking with you!\nAnd this is Titian’s Diana and Actaeon, it's his interpretation of a story from the Roman poet Ovid, of Actaeon, who's a young man, who's out hunting. During a break he goes exploring in a secluded valley. He accidentally stumbles upon Diana, the goddess of the hunt, bathing in a spring with her nymphs. This is an unforgivable transgression, so Diana transforms him into a stag, and he is hunted down by his own hounds and torn apart. For Ovid this was a story of the vicissitudes of fate; how the outcome of your life might change at the drop of a dime. For Titian, it becomes the occasion for him to paint a picture about seeing and being seen, and the loss of innocence that follows.",

Look at him; he is a beautiful young man with a distinct innocence about him, as if he does not quite comprehend what he is seeing but instinctually recognises that it is both exciting and dangerous. We know from scans of the painting that Titian initially painted him leaning forward while drawing the curtain, but decided instead to emphasise his surprise by having him recoil in surprise. This extends the narrative scope of the image by better encompassing action and reaction between Actaeon and Diana. Titian also painted, but later removed a hunting spear that Actaeon was carrying, perhaps better to emphasise his vulnerability.",

But look at the nymphs here: Titian instead depicts them responding in a variety of ways - with surprise, fascination, and horrified anticipation at how their mistress will react. It is like a scene from a harem, with nude women depicted from any number of viewpoints, their fleshy bodies lovingly rendered—this is a favourite subject of Titian’s. The aim is to excite the viewer but, with Actaeon’s fate in mind, probably also to make the viewer reflect on the risks of such excitement.",

It’s a pleasure talking with you!\nAnd this is Titian’s Diana and Actaeon, it's his interpretation of a story from the Roman poet Ovid, of Actaeon, who's a young man, who's out hunting. During a break he goes exploring in a secluded valley. He accidentally stumbles upon Diana, the goddess of the hunt, bathing in a spring with her nymphs. This is an unforgivable transgression, so Diana transforms him into a stag, and he is hunted down by his own hounds and torn apart. For Ovid this was a story of the vicissitudes of fate; how the outcome of your life might change at the drop of a dime. For Titian, it becomes the occasion for him to paint a picture about seeing and being seen, and the loss of innocence that follows.",

Look at him; he is a beautiful young man with a distinct innocence about him, as if he does not quite comprehend what he is seeing but instinctually recognises that it is both exciting and dangerous. We know from scans of the painting that Titian initially painted him leaning forward while drawing the curtain, but decided instead to emphasise his surprise by having him recoil in surprise. This extends the narrative scope of the image by better encompassing action and reaction between Actaeon and Diana. Titian also painted, but later removed a hunting spear that Actaeon was carrying, perhaps better to emphasise his vulnerability.",

         "Info": "In the original poem, Ovid describes how the nymphs immediately rush to cover Diana. But look at the nymphs here: Titian instead depicts them responding in a variety of ways - with surprise, fascination, and horrified anticipation at how their mistress will react. It is like a scene from a harem, with nude women depicted from any number of viewpoints, their fleshy bodies lovingly rendered—this is a favourite subject of Titian’s. The aim is to excite the viewer but, with Actaeon’s fate in mind, probably also to make the viewer reflect on the risks of such excitement.",
