During a break he goes exploring in a secluded valley. He accidentally stumbles upon Diana, the goddess of the hunt, bathing in a spring with her nymphs. This is an unforgivable transgression, so Diana transforms him into a stag, and he is hunted down by his own hounds and torn apart. For Ovid this was a story of the vicissitudes of fate; how the outcome of your life might change at the drop of a dime. For Titian, it becomes the occasion for him to paint a picture about seeing and being seen, and the loss of innocence that follows.",

He might have been more interested in the contrast of light and dark pigments of skin tone, and how this character acts as a pictorial contrast to the light skinned Dianna.\"+\"\\n\"+\"This young woman was probably painted from a model, so was a real person living in 16th Century Venice.

Titian was also from Venice, so he would have known this type of glass very well. In effect, we can see the vase three times in the painting, as it also appears in the mirror and is reflected in the water. Glass blowing was a very dangerous activity in 16th  Century Venice, and the factory’s often caught fire. This is why they were all moved to the island of Murano. So I wonder if there is some symbolism in this choice of Murano glass in this painting which is lost on us today. Titian made another painting called The Annunciation, which also features a glass vase. In The Annunciation, the vase and water inside it are seen as symbols of purity. We can’t say if this vase might also be linked to purity, but its interesting to make the comparison.",

It’s a pleasure talking with you!\nAnd this is Titian’s Diana and Actaeon, it's his interpretation of a story from the Roman poet Ovid, of Actaeon, who's a young man, who's out hunting. During a break he goes exploring in a secluded valley. He accidentally stumbles upon Diana, the goddess of the hunt, bathing in a spring with her nymphs. This is an unforgivable transgression, so Diana transforms him into a stag, and he is hunted down by his own hounds and torn apart. For Ovid this was a story of the vicissitudes of fate; how the outcome of your life might change at the drop of a dime. For Titian, it becomes the occasion for him to paint a picture about seeing and being seen, and the loss of innocence that follows.",

Look at him; he is a beautiful young man with a distinct innocence about him, as if he does not quite comprehend what he is seeing but instinctually recognises that it is both exciting and dangerous. We know from scans of the painting that Titian initially painted him leaning forward while drawing the curtain, but decided instead to emphasise his surprise by having him recoil in surprise. This extends the narrative scope of the image by better encompassing action and reaction between Actaeon and Diana. Titian also painted, but later removed a hunting spear that Actaeon was carrying, perhaps better to emphasise his vulnerability.",

But look at the nymphs here: Titian instead depicts them responding in a variety of ways - with surprise, fascination, and horrified anticipation at how their mistress will react. It is like a scene from a harem, with nude women depicted from any number of viewpoints, their fleshy bodies lovingly rendered—this is a favourite subject of Titian’s. The aim is to excite the viewer but, with Actaeon’s fate in mind, probably also to make the viewer reflect on the risks of such excitement.",
