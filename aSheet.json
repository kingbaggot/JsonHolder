And then, the colour of the background, this theatrical pink, maybe a reminder of his work on the stage, but the colour also makes him stand out; it pushes him outwards closer to us.

I think it’s clear she got to know him quite well from this painting. Even though he’s quite posed, and we can see that this is a performance, where he’s kind of holding us at arms length… we’re also brought in to really close intimacy with Willard, like he’s taking us into confidence.",

T23 There was obviously a lot of trust between the painter and the sitter, between these two artists, because here Clemence has captured the famous showman in a moment of introspection; there’s nothing of that flamboyance, and it’s unposed, dreamy, kind of vulnerable even.",

And the story of this painting actually mirrors Mary’s story. We don’t know much about the painter, Albert Challen, who may have been a friend or neighbour of Mary’s in London, and this painting wasn’t even found until 2004, because it was being used as the backing for another painting; hidden away for more than a century behind a picture of someone else. Now at last this painting, and Mary’s achievements as a medical pioneer, are here for all to see.",

The highlights and shadows on her face create depth and texture that emphasizes her weathered skin and reminds us of her age, but also her adventurous life and her bravery as a war nurse. And then there’s this powerful red, alongside this very royal blue of her clothing… in many ways it’s a very regal painting, which feels right for Mary, the queen of the nursing brigade!",

Mary was extremely proud of her work during the war and her devotion as a healer, which went right back to her  childhood as part of a long tradition of Jamaican and West African Doctresses. Mary said in her biography that she had “from early youth a yearning for medical knowledge and practice which never deserted me….

There’s the mouth, with just a hint of a sneer, and Bowie is all about rebellion. And there’s the suggestion of an eye there, looking out from between the brushstrokes - or what I imagine to be an eye - there could be many different eyes! But that’s because I think this painting is about imagination, just like Bowie’s work. So for me, I almost imagine that eye, almost peeking out through this curtain of colour, like he’s backstage, getting ready for his performance.",

The more I look at it, the more it reminds me not so much of Bowie but of his quality, his manner, and his performance, because he was a masquerader, always incarnating himself into different identities. And so, this painting isn’t just another snapshot of David during one of his phases, but captures something of that essence of constant change.",

I love the way that the artist, the female Iranian photographer Shirin Neshat, has framed Malala so that she’s emerging from the shadows. The starkness of the black-and white, and the way the shadow frames her head, with her face framed in turn by the dark, soft fabric of her hijab… I think it brings all the attention to her eyes, the intensity of her gaze, looking straight out at us in a challenging, confident, empowering gaze. This is a portrait from a female perspective, capturing a powerful, defiant young woman while she’s looking out at the world, looking out at us, and waiting to see what we’re going to do.",

It’s a pleasure talking with you!\nAnd this is Titian’s Diana and Actaeon, it's his interpretation of a story from the Roman poet Ovid, of Actaeon, who's a young man, who's out hunting. During a break he goes exploring in a secluded valley. He accidentally stumbles upon Diana, the goddess of the hunt, bathing in a spring with her nymphs. This is an unforgivable transgression, so Diana transforms him into a stag, and he is hunted down by his own hounds and torn apart. For Ovid this was a story of the vicissitudes of fate; how the outcome of your life might change at the drop of a dime. For Titian, it becomes the occasion for him to paint a picture about seeing and being seen, and the loss of innocence that follows.",

Her braided hair is fastened by a diadem topped by a crescent moon, Diana’s attribute, or symbol. Perhaps Titian wanted to suggest that desire and anger are so closely connected as sometimes to become inseparable.",

From our contemporary perspective, the inclusion of this black figure has many political and cultural associations and ramifications. The African presence in renascence Europe is a large topic. But for Titian, the inclusion of this figure may have been more aesthetic. He might have been more interested in the contrast of light and dark pigments of skin tone, and how this character acts as a pictorial contrast to the light skinned Dianna.\"+\"\\n\"+\"This young woman was probably painted from a model, so was a real person living in 16th Century Venice. So who was she, and what was her life like? Outside of the mythology depicted in the painting. I want to know more about the real person. Who did she live with? Did she model for other artists? Where is she buried?",

Titian was also from Venice, so he would have known this type of glass very well. In effect, we can see the vase three times in the painting, as it also appears in the mirror and is reflected in the water. Glass blowing was a very dangerous activity in 16th  Century Venice, and the factory’s often caught fire. This is why they were all moved to the island of Murano. So I wonder if there is some symbolism in this choice of Murano glass in this painting which is lost on us today. Titian made another painting called The Annunciation, which also features a glass vase. In The Annunciation, the vase and water inside it are seen as symbols of purity. We can’t say if this vase might also be linked to purity, but its interesting to make the comparison.",

It’s a pleasure talking with you!\nAnd this is Titian’s Diana and Actaeon, it's his interpretation of a story from the Roman poet Ovid, of Actaeon, who's a young man, who's out hunting. During a break he goes exploring in a secluded valley. He accidentally stumbles upon Diana, the goddess of the hunt, bathing in a spring with her nymphs. This is an unforgivable transgression, so Diana transforms him into a stag, and he is hunted down by his own hounds and torn apart. For Ovid this was a story of the vicissitudes of fate; how the outcome of your life might change at the drop of a dime. For Titian, it becomes the occasion for him to paint a picture about seeing and being seen, and the loss of innocence that follows.",

Look at him; he is a beautiful young man with a distinct innocence about him, as if he does not quite comprehend what he is seeing but instinctually recognises that it is both exciting and dangerous. We know from scans of the painting that Titian initially painted him leaning forward while drawing the curtain, but decided instead to emphasise his surprise by having him recoil in surprise. This extends the narrative scope of the image by better encompassing action and reaction between Actaeon and Diana. Titian also painted, but later removed a hunting spear that Actaeon was carrying, perhaps better to emphasise his vulnerability.",

But look at the nymphs here: Titian instead depicts them responding in a variety of ways - with surprise, fascination, and horrified anticipation at how their mistress will react. It is like a scene from a harem, with nude women depicted from any number of viewpoints, their fleshy bodies lovingly rendered—this is a favourite subject of Titian’s. The aim is to excite the viewer but, with Actaeon’s fate in mind, probably also to make the viewer reflect on the risks of such excitement.",
