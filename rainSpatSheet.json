I just need that chance,\n In two years time I don’t wanna be Hustling CDs up in the dance.\n I wanna be on that stage. I wanna be on that mic,\n I wanna be an artist with a fan base that weren’t just built on hype.\n\n So once again thanks for your time,\n Please take time to check out the tunes,\n I took a chance thinking you was into rap When I saw you in the Hip Hop room.\n I wish more of these man were were like you, Some won’t even take a free CD.\n You enjoy the rest of your night.

You’ve gone as white as a ghost.\n It's a private party, and guess who's your host.\n Let me pour you a drink. You don't look too well.\n Shame your mate’s not about. Should we give him a bell?\n Honestly pal, I just wanna have a chat.\n A friendly one at that, so don't act like a prat.\n All your life son, you made wrong decisions. \n\nPAUL\n Damn right he has, what he done to me can't be forgiven!\n What, you think I’ll forgive and forget? \n I don't care if you got regrets.\n You had no remorse when you stole her,\n Tried to control her,\n Broke her heart, never sober.\n How could she love you more than she loved me?\n When she told me it was over\n It killed me. Literally it killed me.\n You thought I was weak. Time to meet the real me.\n You never spared a thought for me when my world caved in - \n\nMIKE\n But thank God I was there to save him.\n He was in a right state, but I don't suppose you cared\n With me sister on your arm. \n\nPAUL\n Mike, it just wasn't fair! \n\nMIKE\n Yeah I know Paul, but tonight we're gonna make it right.\n Remember what I told you - trust in Mike.\n I got Lucas to sort his mate, he'll be in no state to fight!\n His little junkie mate will be having the time of his life. \n\nPAUL\n Finally some justice I've waited so long,\n I loved her so much I never could move on.\n And when I heard how he was treating her, it made it even worse…\n\nMIKE\n I know son, your deepest love is always your first -\n Gift and a curse. I told you I’d get him for what he done.\n You’re a big part of this, but now run along son.\n Good job Paul, you've always been a good lad.\n Shame my sister never knew the good man that she had,\n But this is my world and you know the rules,\n I'm gonna deal with him my way. \n\nPAUL\n Who's the fool now? It’s payback time! \n I'll leave you with Mike.\n\nMIKE\n Well done again Paul, I'll call you later tonight. \n\n-\n\nMIKE\n Look what we have here, all on your ones.\n Nowhere to hide, and nowhere to run.\n It's payback season don't act all dumb,\n You had the whole family fooled, even my Mum.\n But never me. I always knew you and my sister wouldn't last,\n And now you think you can move on from the past?\n There's always consequences for the actions you take,\n Can't get away with what you did to me, that's too much to take.\n I heard her cry herself to sleep at night, while you and your mates\n Were all popping champagne. Bunch of wannabe fakes,\n Big dog, small puppies, living it up,\n And about my sisters feelings? You couldn't give a fuck.\n\n Don't act like you care now the damage is done,\n I told you there's nowhere to hide & nowhere to run,\n It's time for a straightener, me and you son.\n Nobody else. It's a one on one. \n\nBOUNCER\n What the hells going on here? \n\nMIKE\n Nothing my bro, just having a little talk,\n We’re old mates so go that way. \n Hold a score in your pocket and walk. \n\nBOUNCER\n What, you bribing me?\n I told you at the door you best behave in here,\n I take my job seriously. I hope you got that clear.\n And I don't fear you wanna be Gs screaming out “gang gang”,\n I've had as much as I can take in here. \n\nMIKE\n Old man, run along now. \n\nBOUNCER\n Who you calling old? \n\nMIKE\n Run along Pops, for your own good. You been told.\n I got business to handle, you’re getting in the way. \n\nBOUNCER\n I can see what's gonna happen. \n\nMIKE\n Yeah it's going down today. \n\nBOUNCER\n Nothing's going down today.\n You are leaving the club.\n We ain't having no scraps. No fighting, no drugs.\n \nMIKE\n No drugs! That's a laugh, you’re pushing ‘em bruv! \n\nBOUNCER\n You are pushing it, son. \n\nMIKE\n You bouncers are mugs!\n\nBOUNCER 2\n Sorry Steve, is there a problem? \n\nBOUNCER\n These guys are just leaving.\n Let me show ‘em to the exit.\n\nBOUNCER 2\n I'll help you out, Steven. \n\nBOUNCER\n \"Your night’s over, both of you. Time to go.\n Cmon let's be having ya, yes you and your bro.\n I've had enough of all you little boys who wanna play tough,\n All mouth and no trousers, and you’re talking all rough.\n Now I'm calling your bluff, cause I know it's an act,\n So get out of the club and do not come back. You’re BARRED!\n\n-\n\nBOUNCER\n Right my son, you're the one they call the Player, yeah? You'd better head back to the Main Dance Room. But first, a word in your ear:\n\n\n You need to watch the company you keep.\n You reap what you sow on these dirty London streets.\n But I could see what was about to happen son,\n So let's put this down to experience, and say you owe me one.\n I'll have my eye on you. Any more trouble\n And you'll be out the door on the double.\n But for now, you can go back in, it's alright,\n Behave your bloody self, I hope you have a bloody good night.",

God knows I’ve tried,\n But I can’t just keep on living a lie.\n Look me in the eye and just tell me straight,\n Do you think we could be much more than mates?\n\nROOKIE’S GIRLFRIEND\n Wow, I can’t believe you even asked me that.\n I’m in love with your friend and that’s a fact.\n\nFRIEND\n See I love the way that you got his back,\n but it seems to me that you’re trapped.\n Trapped in a partnership that’s so one sided,\n I wanna give you my undivided\n Attention. So, after much soul searching, I came to realise - yes I’ve decided\n You’re the one. It’s like Cupid collided\n And bought us together with the love he provided.\n And trust me I know that the setting ain’t perfect,\n I’d lose him but that would be worth it,\n I’ll put all it on the line,\n If I could make you mine.\n I wouldn’t be out on the grind all the time.\n And this ain’t no chat up line -\n He don’t appreciate you or see your worth,\n but I just wanna see you shine.\n And I just wanna make you mine.\n\nROOKIE’S GIRLFRIEND\n I’m sorry but this ain’t the place or time - ROOKIE\n Yes you two! What are you talking about?\n\nFRIEND\n Nothing my brother! Just sipping on a stout and keeping her company…\n\nROOKIE\n Aww, that’s bless! You know you’re my G, no doubt.\n Sorry I was gone long, but I sold two CDs! Are you good babes?\n\nROOKIE’S GIRLFRIEND Yeah, I’m just glad you’re back…\n \n ROOKIE\n I’m yours for the night! Hold on - two secs, \n is that Harry Shotta all dressed in black?\n I gotta holler him! I gotta give him my track!\n He might even stop and hear me rap!\n\nROOKIE’S GIRLFRIEND\n But babes - \n\nROOKIE\n Don’t worry, I’ll be back in a minute,\n I just wanna see if he will take a listen to my lyrics.\n Yo Shotta, Shottz! \n\nFRIEND\n There he goes again.

You’ve gone as white as a ghost.\n It's a private party, and guess who's your host.\n Let me pour you a drink. You don't look too well.\n Shame your mate’s not about. Should we give him a bell?\n Honestly pal, I just wanna have a chat.\n A friendly one at that, so don't act like a prat.\n All your life son, you made wrong decisions. \n\nPAUL\n Damn right he has, what he done to me can't be forgiven!\n What, you think I’ll forgive and forget? \n I don't care if you got regrets.\n You had no remorse when you stole her,\n Tried to control her,\n Broke her heart, never sober.\n How could she love you more than she loved me?\n When she told me it was over\n It killed me. Literally it killed me.\n You thought I was weak. Time to meet the real me.\n You never spared a thought for me when my world caved in - \n\nMIKE\n But thank God I was there to save him.\n He was in a right state, but I don't suppose you cared\n With me sister on your arm. \n\nPAUL\n Mike, it just wasn't fair! \n\nMIKE\n Yeah I know Paul, but tonight we're gonna make it right.\n Remember what I told you - trust in Mike.\n I got Lucas to sort his mate, he'll be in no state to fight!\n His little junkie mate will be having the time of his life. \n\nPAUL\n Finally some justice I've waited so long,\n I loved her so much I never could move on.\n And when I heard how he was treating her, it made it even worse…\n\nMIKE\n I know son, your deepest love is always your first -\n Gift and a curse. I told you I’d get him for what he done.\n You’re a big part of this, but now run along son.\n Good job Paul, you've always been a good lad.\n Shame my sister never knew the good man that she had,\n But this is my world and you know the rules,\n I'm gonna deal with him my way. \n\nPAUL\n Who's the fool now? It’s payback time! \n I'll leave you with Mike.\n\nMIKE\n Well done again Paul, I'll call you later tonight. \n\n-\n\nMIKE\n Look what we have here, all on your ones.\n Nowhere to hide, and nowhere to run.\n It's payback season don't act all dumb,\n You had the whole family fooled, even my Mum.\n But never me. I always knew you and my sister wouldn't last,\n And now you think you can move on from the past?\n There's always consequences for the actions you take,\n Can't get away with what you did to me, that's too much to take.\n I heard her cry herself to sleep at night, while you and your mates\n Were all popping champagne. Bunch of wannabe fakes,\n Big dog, small puppies, living it up,\n And about my sisters feelings? You couldn't give a fuck.\n\n Don't act like you care now the damage is done,\n I told you there's nowhere to hide & nowhere to run,\n It's time for a straightener, me and you son.\n Nobody else. It's a one on one. \n\nBOUNCER\n What the hells going on here? \n\nMIKE\n Nothing my bro, just having a little talk,\n We’re old mates so go that way. \n Hold a score in your pocket and walk. \n\nBOUNCER\n What, you bribing me?\n I told you at the door you best behave in here,\n I take my job seriously. I hope you got that clear.\n And I don't fear you wanna be Gs screaming out “gang gang”,\n I've had as much as I can take in here. \n\nMIKE\n Old man, run along now. \n\nBOUNCER\n Who you calling old? \n\nMIKE\n Run along Pops, for your own good. You been told.\n I got business to handle, you’re getting in the way. \n\nBOUNCER\n I can see what's gonna happen. \n\nMIKE\n Yeah it's going down today. \n\nBOUNCER\n Nothing's going down today.\n You are leaving the club.\n We ain't having no scraps. No fighting, no drugs.\n \nMIKE\n No drugs! That's a laugh, you’re pushing ‘em bruv! \n\nBOUNCER\n You are pushing it, son. \n\nMIKE\n You bouncers are mugs!\n\nBOUNCER 2\n Sorry Steve, is there a problem? \n\nBOUNCER\n These guys are just leaving.\n Let me show ‘em to the exit.\n\nBOUNCER 2\n I'll help you out, Steven. \n\nBOUNCER\n \"Your night’s over, both of you.

You’re BARRED!\n\n-\n\nBOUNCER\n Right my son, you're the one they call the Player, yeah? You'd better head back to the Main Dance Room. But first, a word in your ear:\n\n\n You need to watch the company you keep.\n You reap what you sow on these dirty London streets.\n But I could see what was about to happen son,\n So let's put this down to experience, and say you owe me one.\n I'll have my eye on you.
