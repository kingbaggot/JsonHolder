 There you are!
 Awww look at you big man, some things'll never change.
 You would have thought you would have grown up, but nah, you're still the same
 Ain’t ya? Same shirt, with your 9 carat chain,
 Still moving in the same lane, trying to play the same game.
 Me, I try to maintain. I ain’t saying I’m perfect,
 But you just play the blame game and stay up on the circuit.
 Can I you ask you something? Honestly, was it worth it?
 She loved the man behind the front. What you show on the surface
 Ain’t even the real you. Even I know that.
 If you could turn back the hands of time, would you go back?
 I need to know: do you have regrets over how you treated her?
 She was strong, and you psychologically defeated her.
 I see the tears, I see the pain, and that’s why I’m like: fuck you.
 I don’t know why but I swear she still loves you.
 She can’t even move on, she put no one above you,
 I don’t know why I’m telling you. Remember her belling you?
 To find out where you was when you were supposed to be home,
 But you didn’t care did you? You was all in your zone,
 I know she dumped YOU too, so why you giving the perception,
 That you're the one who said you wanna go a new direction?
 It’s all image with you. It’s all about your rep,
 But she’s looking better than you the last time that I checked!
 If I tell you this, you know you need to show her respect,
 Guess what - she’s here tonight if you wanna connect.
 She’s my friend, 'course I wanna protect her,
 But I’m with my man tonight, so if you wanna talk yeah I can direct ya
 To where she is, but you must be sincere.
 If you're still on your BS, I need to make this clear:
 You should leave her alone. You broke that girl’s heart.
 If you really have changed then that’s a good start,
 
 Hold on, who you here with, oh not that clown!
 When will you learn? He’s just dragging you down
 To his level. This might be your last chance,
 Tell him do one! She’s only in the other room having a dance,
 If you really wanna make up for the shit that you did,
 Time to man up and stop acting like a little kid.
 And if she sees him with you, just imagine her face!
 She blames him for a lot of this shit in the first place.

 Stay here for a second.
 I can't see your boy nowhere out here, but let me tell you what I reckon.
 About your mate, he's overly bait.
 Don't get offended. Listen, wait.
 Everyone says that he's holding you back,
 Cause he can't even get his own life on track.
 Stuck in the same old job for ages.,
 Stuck in the same old flat for years.
 Where's the elevation? At least with you got a good career!
 And you had a girl that loved you too,
 And you fucked that right up didn't you?

 And you probably don't think I got the right
 To criticise him or the way he moves.
 By the look on the face I can tell you’re thinking I’m chatting a bag ah shite.
 But I see that boy tonight,
 All drunk up, probably sniffing white,
 All gassed up just coz it's Friday night.
 (Two secs mate, have you got a spare light?)
 All I'm saying is: why do you follow the games he's playing?
 He says jump, you say “how high”?
 I know deep down you’re not that guy.
 I'm just asking you why.
 I'm trying to understand.
 Are you scared of him? What's the reason?
 Tonight for Instance, what's the plan?
 He's dragging you down, you don't wanna hear it.
 I'm giving you the truth; you fear it.
 it's your choice at the end of the day,

 It's a private party, and guess who's your host.
 Let me pour you a drink. You don't look too well.
 Shame your mate’s not about. Should we give him a bell?
 Honestly pal, I just wanna have a chat.
 A friendly one at that, so don't act like a prat.
 All your life son, you made wrong decisions. PAUL
 Damn right he has, what he done to me can't be forgiven!
 What, you think I’ll forgive and forget? I don't care if you got regrets.
 You had no remorse when you stole her,
 Tried to control her,
 Broke her heart, never sober.
 How could she love you more than she loved me?
 When she told me it was over
 It killed me. Literally it killed me.
 You thought I was weak. Time to meet the real me.
 You never spared a thought for me when my world caved in - MIKE
 But thank God I was there to save him.
 He was in a right state, but I don't suppose you cared
 With me sister on your arm. PAUL
 Mike, it just wasn't fair! MIKE
 Yeah I know Paul, but tonight we're gonna make it right.
 Remember what I told you - trust in Mike.
 I got Lucas to sort his mate, he'll be in no state to fight!
 His little junkie mate will be having the time of his life. PAUL
 Finally some justice I've waited so long,
 I loved her so much I never could move on.
 And when I heard how he was treating her, it made it even worse…
 MIKE
 I know son, your deepest love is always your first -
 Gift and a curse. I told you I’d get him for what he done.
 You’re a big part of this, but now run along son.
 Good job Paul, you've always been a good lad.
 Shame my sister never knew the good man that she had,
 But this is my world and you know the rules,
 I'm gonna deal with him my way. PAUL
 Who's the fool now? It’s payback time! I'll leave you with Mike.
 MIKE
 Well done again Paul, I'll call you later tonight. MIKE
 Look what we have here, all on your ones.
 Nowhere to hide, and nowhere to run.
 It's payback season don't act all dumb,
 You had the whole family fooled, even my Mum.
 But never me. I always knew you and my sister wouldn't last,
 And now you think you can move on from the past?
 There's always consequences for the actions you take,
 Can't get away with what you did to me, that's too much to take.
 I heard her cry herself to sleep at night, while you and your mates
 Were all popping champagne. Bunch of wannabe fakes,
 Big dog, small puppies, living it up,
 And about my sisters feelings? You couldn't give it a fuck.
 Don't act like you care now the damage is done,
 I told you there's nowhere to hide & nowhere to run,
 It's time for a straightener, me and you son.
 Nobody else. It's a one on one. BOUNCER
 What the hells going on here? MIKE
 Nothing my bro, just having a little talk,
 We’re old mates so go that way. Hold a score in your pocket and walk. BOUNCER
 What, you bribing me?
 I told you at the door you best behave in here,
 I take my job seriously. I hope you got that clear.
 And I don't fear you wanna be Gs screaming out “gang gang”,
 I've had as much as I can take in here. MIKE
 Old man, run along now. BOUNCER
 Who you calling old? MIKE
 Run along Pops, for your own good. You been told.
 I got business to handle, you’re getting in the way. BOUNCER
 I can see what's gonna happen. MIKE
 Yeah it's going down today, BOUNCER
 Nothing's going down today.
 You are leaving the club.
 We ain't having no scraps. No fighting, no drugs.
 MIKE
 No drugs! That's a laugh, you’re pushing ‘em bruv! BOUNCER
 You are pushing it, son. MIKE
 You bouncers are mugs!
 BOUNCER 2
 Sorry Steve, is there a problem? BOUNCER
 These guys are just leaving.
 Let me show ‘em to the exit.
 BOUNCER 2 I'll help you out, Steven. BOUNCER
 ""Your night’s over, both of you. Time to go.
 Cmon let's be having ya, yes you and your bro.
 I've had enough of all you little boys who wanna play tough,
 All mouth and no trousers, and you’re talking all rough.
 Now I'm calling your bluff, cause I know it's an act,
 So get out of the club and do not come back. You’re BARRED! - BOUNCER
 Right my son, you're the one they call the Player, yeah? You'd better head back to the Main Dance Room. But first, a word in your ear:
 You need to watch the company you keep.
 You reap what you sow on these dirty London streets.
 But I could see what was about to happen son,
 So let's put this down to experience, and say you owe me one.
 I'll have my eye on you. Any more trouble
 And you'll be out the door on the double.
 But for now, you can go back in, it's alright,
 Behave your bloody self, I hope you have a bloody good night.",VIP

 And fix your mistakes through me.
 I’m an adult Mike, I need to be free. MIKE
 He’s no good for you, can’t you see? YOUR EX
 I know you care, but let me be,
 Otherwise this bond will come to an end. MIKE
 You're my little sis who I need to defend.
 And be protected. The world’s infected
 With so many scumbags and you have selected
 One to be your boyfriend. I can’t have that. YOUR EX
 He looks just like you when you was his age, Up in the club with your Gucci Belt and your snapback,
 Skanking around to a rap track;
 Armani jeans with the matching back pack.
 Truth hurts. Do you see your self when you look at him? Scratch that,
 Are you trying to match that?
 Driving around in a hatchback,
 You can’t take back the things that you’ve done in your life, you need to let go.
 And if you can’t do that, right now tonight you need to let me know.
 Cause I will not be controlled In your little monopoly.
 I’m living my life, and Mike Your hangups are not stopping me.
 I’m talking honestly. I’m your sister not your property,
 Go home, look after your child And take your hands off of me.",EX VS MIKE

 I can't believe you don't wanna get high!
 I wanna have a good time, you could at least try.
 You’re selfish. Now you got me on the wrong vibe,
 You said you was down to get waved and you lied, you lied!
 I bet you’re probably thinking bout that chick,
 It's mandem over women my G, you've slipped.
 Should have stuck to the script. Thought man was a soldier.
 You seem to be changing as we're getting older.
 You know what brother? You’re not the man that you was.
 I had your back hard see, and that was all because
 You always had mine, from 19 long time
 When everybody else went, you was still my partner in crime.
 And that's why I was glad when you and her split!
 I can't even believe that I'm telling you, what is this shit?
 But when you and her were together, I was stuck on the shelf.
 You left me like the rest of them, focused on your self.
 You left me like my father did when I was only eight,
 You abandoned me like mummy that day at the school gate -
 I feel so much hate. I just don't know what to do,
 Still ain't dealt with the pain and I'm nearly 22. And all I wanted was a night out, couple of laughs Couple smiles, couple jokes, little champs in my glass And you couldn’t even give me that! You’re such a good friend, ain’t cha? Well now it’s time for this friendship to end. Don’t even try to look at me, the whole night’s ruined.

 This ain't the time or the place - YOUR EX

 Why you gotta hang around with that idiot, drinking out with your crew?
 We had something - you threw it away.
 You knew that I had your back from day.
 You used to say you felt the same way, but you never showed me. You just betrayed.
 I made you dinner, you never came,
 No explanation till the next day.
 You said that you fell asleep on the train. All your excuses, so lame.
 And when I saw you tonight, at first I was glad to see you again,
 But when I saw that look your eyes it just bought back the pain.
 The memories of the hurt you bought me. And look what happened tonight!
 Don’t think I wasn’t watching that idiot and Lucas get into a fight.
 It could have been you in that position.
 I know that’s not you. You need to listen,
 Stop looking away! Look into my eyes. Saving you was once my mission.
 You need to change, switch up your path.
 I’m not saying don’t go out with your mates but, On a real on a real, Some of your mates, they make me laugh.
 ‘Cause they’re going nowhere, every weekend
 the same thing. And the worst thing is that
 Deep down, you’re smart. You know it’s the truth I’m speaking.
 So where do you wanna go from here?
 I’m here but you need to promise me
 That you will change. You can change, and deal with me honestly.
 I’m sorry that I called you a waste,
 Do you remember us skanking to Drum N Bass?
 Skanking out, face to face?
 We can get to that special place
 Again. No more pain. No more lies.
 Let’s just rave. Let’s just vibe
 Me and you. No divide.
 It’s about time you turned the tide.
 Come with me, let’s have fun.
 Celebrate love to the bass and drum,
 That set you wanted to check started at one,
 It’s your choice but I want you come.",DANCEOUT

consq_lovetriangle,,,consq_lovetriangle,,,130,,,,UWV,Main Dance,"FRIEND Has he gone again? ROOKIE’S GIRLFRIEND
 Yeah, he's going round the club trying to sell CDs, trying to get people to listen to him rap. You know him.
 FRIEND Yeah I know him, and I know you too. I’ve been waiting all night for a time when it was just me and you.
 I know he’s my boy and all that babes but I really gotta keep it true.
 He doesn’t care for you in the way I do. See I know him, he’s married to his music.
 Right now he’s out with you, and he’s hustling CDs! That’s gotta prove it.
 If he had a choice, you or a deal, that contract trust me he’s gonna choose it.
 If there were two choices on the table, blowing up in the music - he won’t refuse it.
 You deserve much better than that Forget settling for second best.
 And I tried to hold back my feelings, but I feel you’re different from all the rest,
 And I see how you look at me sometimes, so I know that we’ve got a connection. ROOKIE’S GIRLFRIEND
 You’re supposed to be his friend though! FRIEND
 I am his friend, but when I look in your direction
 I can’t help feeling the things I feel.
 And when I see you tonight all dressed to kill
 And he doesn’t appreciate all your efforts, I’m like: nah man I gotta keep it real.
 I can’t hold it in. God knows I’ve tried,
 But I can’t just keep on living a lie.
 Look me in the eye and just tell me straight,
 Do you think we could be much more than mates? ROOKIE’S GIRLFRIEND
 Wow, I can’t believe you even asked me that.
 I’m in love with your friend and that’s a fact. FRIEND
 See I love the way that you got his back, but it seems to me that you’re trapped.
 Trapped in a partnership that’s so one sided,
 I wanna give you my undivided
 Attention. So, after much soul searching, I came to realise - yes I’ve decided
 You’re the one. It’s like Cupid collided
 And bought us together with the love he provided.
 And trust me I know that the setting ain’t perfect,
 I’d lose him but that would be worth it,
 I’ll put all it on the line,
 If I could make you mine.
 I wouldn’t be out on the grind all the time.
 And this ain’t no chat up line -
 He don’t appreciate you or see your worth, but I just wanna see you shine.
 And I just wanna make you mine. ROOKIE’S GIRLFRIEND
 I’m sorry but this ain’t the place or time - ROOKIE
 Yes you two! What are you talking about? FRIEND
 Nothing my brother! Just sipping on a stout and keeping her company… ROOKIE
 Aww, that’s bless! You know you’re my G, no doubt.
 Sorry I was gone long, but I sold two CDs! Are you good babes?
 ROOKIE’S GIRLFRIEND Yeah, I’m just glad you’re back…
 
 ROOKIE
 I’m yours for the night! Hold on - two secs, is that Harry Shotta all dressed in black?
 I gotta holler him! I gotta give him my track!
 He might even stop and hear me Rap! ROOKIE’S GIRLFRIEND
 But babes - ROOKIE
 Don’t worry, I’ll be back in a minute,
 I just wanna see if he will take a listen to my lyrics.
 Yo Shotta, Shottz! FRIEND
 There he goes again. Another chance that he’s got to take.
 But if the cost of making it was to lose you, Then I know the choice that I’d have to make.",
